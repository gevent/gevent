# Takes out ``if x == 0:`` and wants you to write ``if not x:``
# but in many cases, the == 0 is actually much more clear.

#    pylint.extensions.mccabe,
# We have too many too-complex methods. We should enable this and fix them
# one by one.

#    pylint.extensions.redefined_variable_type,
# We use that pattern during initialization.

# magic_value wants you to not use arbitrary strings and numbers
# inline in the code. But it's overzealous and has way too many false
# positives. Trust people to do the most readable thing.
#   pylint.extensions.magic_value

# Empty comment would be good, except it detects blank lines within
# a single comment block.
#
# Those are often used to separate paragraphs, like here.
#   pylint.extensions.empty_comment,

# consider_ternary_expression is a nice check, but is also overzealous.
# Trust the human to do the readable thing.

# redefined_loop_name tends to catch us with things like

# This wants you to turn ``x in (1, 2)`` into ``x in {1, 2}``.
# They both result in the LOAD_CONST bytecode, one a tuple one a
# frozenset. In theory a set lookup using hashing is faster than
# a linear scan of a tuple; but if the tuple is small, it can often
# actually be faster to scan the tuple.

# Fix zope.cachedescriptors.property.Lazy; the property-classes doesn't seem to
# do anything.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51160955/pylint-how-to-specify-a-self-defined-property-decorator-with-property-classes
# For releases prior to 2.14.2, this needs to be a one-line, quoted string. After that,
# a multi-line string.
# - Make zope.cachedescriptors.property.Lazy look like a property;
#   fixes pylint thinking it is a method.
# - Run in Pure Python mode (ignore C extensions that respect this);
#   fixes some issues with zope.interface, like IFoo.providedby(ob)
#   claiming not to have the right number of parameters...except no, it does not.

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).
# NOTE: comments must go ABOVE the statement. In Python 2, mixing in
# comments disables all directives that follow, while in Python 3, putting
# comments at the end of the line does the same thing (though Py3 supports
# mixing)


# invalid-name, ; We get lots of these, especially in scripts. should fix many of them
# protected-access, ; We have many cases of this; legit ones need to be examinid and commented, then this removed

# useless-suppression: the only way to avoid repeating it for specific statements everywhere that we
#   do Py2/Py3 stuff is to put it here. Sadly this means that we might get better but not realize it.
# duplicate-code: Yeah, the compatibility ssl modules are much the same
# In pylint 1.8.0, inconsistent-return-statements are created for the wrong reasons.
# This code raises it, even though there's only one return (the implicit 'return None' is presumably
# what triggers it):
#  def foo():
#    if baz:
#      return 1
# In Pylint 2dev1, needed for Python 3.7, we get spurious 'useless return' errors:
# @property
# def foo(self):
#   return None # generates useless-return
# Pylint 2.4 adds import-outside-toplevel. But we do that a lot to defer imports because of patching.
# Pylint 2.4 adds self-assigning-variable. But we do *that* to avoid unused-import when we
# "export" the variable and don't have a __all__.
# Pylint 2.6+ adds some python-3-only things that don't apply: raise-missing-from, super-with-arguments, consider-using-f-string, redundant-u-string-prefix
# unnecessary-lambda-assignment: New check introduced in v2.14.0
# unnecessary-dunder-call: New check introduced in v2.14.0
# consider-using-assignment-expr: wants you to use the walrus operator.
#   It hits way too much and its not clear they would be improvements.
# confusing-consecutive-elif: Are they though?
