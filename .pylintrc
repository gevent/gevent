[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).
# NOTE: comments must go ABOVE the statement. In Python 2, mixing in
# comments disables all directives that follow, while in Python 3, putting
# comments at the end of the line does the same thing (though Py3 supports
# mixing)


# invalid-name, ; We get lots of these, especially in scripts. should fix many of them
# protected-access, ; We have many cases of this; legit ones need to be examinid and commented, then this removed
# no-self-use, ; common in superclasses with extension points
# too-few-public-methods, ; Exception and marker classes get tagged with this
# exec-used, ; should tag individual instances with this, there are some but not too many
# global-statement,     ; should tag individual instances
# multiple-statements, ; "from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()"
# locally-disabled, ; yes, we know we're doing this. don't replace one warning with another
# cyclic-import, ; most of these are deferred imports
# too-many-arguments, ; these are almost always because that's what the stdlib does
# redefined-builtin, ; likewise: these tend to be keyword arguments like len= in the stdlib
# undefined-all-variable,     ; XXX: This crashes with pylint 1.5.4 on Travis (but not locally on Py2/3
#     ; or landscape.io on Py3). The file causing the problem is unclear. UPDATE: identified and disabled
#   that file.
#   see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/846
# useless-suppression: the only way to avoid repeating it for specific statements everywhere that we
#   do Py2/Py3 stuff is to put it here. Sadly this means that we might get better but not realize it.
# duplicate-code: Yeah, the compatibility ssl modules are much the same
# In pylint 1.8.0, inconsistent-return-statements are created for the wrong reasons.
# This code raises it, even though there's only one return (the implicit 'return None' is presumably
# what triggers it):
#  def foo():
#    if baz:
#      return 1
# In Pylint 2dev1, needed for Python 3.7, we get spurious 'useless return' errors:
# @property
# def foo(self):
#   return None # generates useless-return

# List of members which are set dynamically and missed by pylint inference
# system, and so shouldn't trigger E1101 when accessed. Python regular
# expressions are accepted.
# gevent: this is helpful for py3/py2 code.

# List of classes names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for classes with attributes dynamically set). This supports can work
# with qualified names.
# greenlet, Greenlet, parent, dead: all attempts to fix issues in greenlet.py
# only seen on the service, e.g., self.parent.loop: class parent has no loop

# List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime
# and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis. It
# supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.
