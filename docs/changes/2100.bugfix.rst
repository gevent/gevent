Fix several possible interpreter crashes when there are race
conditions or programmers don't follow the documented rules and close
open files while they are still in use by other components.

For example, :meth:`selectors.BaseSelector.unregister` says "A file
object shall be unregistered prior to being closed." Failure to do so
is implementation dependent; in gevent, with libev compiled with
debugging enabled, this would crash the process, and with libuv,
an unexpected, uncatchable exception would be raised. Now, more common
failure scenarios are handled gracefully.

This also means that gevent now monkey-patches :func:`os.close` (on
POSIX) to help handle these cases.
