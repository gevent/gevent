Monkey-patching the ``queue`` module (done by default in
``patch_all``) now patches ``Queue``, ``PriorityQueue``, and
``LifoQueue``. In addition to the general benefits of making all those
classes cooperative, this is known to solve a non-deterministic
deadlock with ``urllib3``.

In addition, ``Queue`` was renamed to ``SimpleQueue``; previously
``SimpleQueue`` was an alias for the undocumented
``queue._PySimpleQueue``. This makes ``SimpleQueue`` cooperative even
without monkey-patching.

Likewise, ``JoinableQueue`` was renamed to ``Queue``, providing the
``join`` method to all ``Queue`` objects, thus matching the standard
library. The old name remains for backwards compatibility.
