Stop bulding with -Ofast to prevent altering the global state of the process with regard
to floating point precision (see https://simonbyrne.github.io/notes/fastmath/).

(Previous attempt to keep -Ofast while adding -fno-fast-math proved futile, as both
on clang and gcc -Ofast would enable "fast math" regardless.)
