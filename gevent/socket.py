"""Cooperative socket module.

This module provides socket operations and some related functions.
The API of the functions and classes matches the API of the corresponding
items in standard :mod:`socket` module exactly, but the synchronous functions
in this module only block the current greenlet and let the others run.

For convenience, exceptions (like :class:`error <socket.error>` and :class:`timeout <socket.timeout>`)
as well as the constants from :mod:`socket` module are imported into this module.
