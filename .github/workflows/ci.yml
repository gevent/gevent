###
# Important notes on GitHub actions:
#
# - We only get 2,000 free minutes a month
# - We only get 500MB of artifact storage
# - Cache storage is limited to 7 days and 5GB.
# - macOS minutes are 10x as expensive as Linux minutes
# - windows minutes are twice as expensive.
#
# So keep those workflows light.
#
# In December 2020, github only supports x86/64. If we wanted to test
# gevent on other architectures, we might be able to use docker
# emulation, but there's no native support.
#
# Another major downside: You can't just re-run the job for one part
# of the matrix. So if there's a transient test failure that hit, say, 3.8,
# to get a clean run every version of Python runs again. That's bad.
