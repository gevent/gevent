Make the standard library cooperative.

Patching
========

The primary purpose of this module is to carefully patch, in place,
portions of the standard library with gevent-friendly functions that
behave in the same way as the original (at least as closely as possible).

The primary interface to this is the :func:`patch_all` function, which
performs all the available patches. It accepts arguments to limit the
patching to certain modules, but most programs will want to use the
default values as they receive the most wide-spread testing.

Patching *should be done as early as possible* in the lifecycle of the
program. For example, the main module (the one that tests against
``__main__`` or is otherwise the first imported) should begin with
this code, ideally before any other imports::

    from gevent import monkey
    monkey.patch_all()

.. tip::

    Some frameworks, such as gunicorn, handle monkey-patching for you.
    Check their documentation to be sure.

Querying
--------

Sometimes it is helpful to know if objects have been monkey-patched, and in
advanced cases even to have access to the original standard library functions. This
module provides functions for that purpose.

- :func:`is_module_patched`
- :func:`is_object_patched`
- :func:`get_original`

Use as a module
===============

Sometimes it is useful to run existing python scripts or modules that
were not built to be gevent aware under gevent. To do so, this module
can be run as the main module, passing the script and its arguments.
For details, see the :func:`main` function.

    # by gevent, as it returns just a fileno. _multiprocessing.Connection is an internal implementation
