"""
Managing greenlets in a group.

The :class:`Group` class in this module abstracts a group of running
greenlets. When a greenlet dies, it's automatically removed from the
group. All running greenlets in a group can be waited on with
:meth:`Group.join`, or all running greenlets can be killed with
:meth:`Group.kill`.

The :class:`Pool` class, which is a subclass of :class:`Group`,
provides a way to limit concurrency: its :meth:`spawn <Pool.spawn>`
method blocks if the number of greenlets in the pool has already
reached the limit, until there is a free slot.
