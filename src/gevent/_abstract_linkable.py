        # maintained the order of notifications, but Event did not.

        # In gevent 1.3, before Semaphore extended this class, that
        # was changed to not maintain the order. It was done because
        # Event guaranteed to only call callbacks once (a set) but
        # AsyncResult had no such guarantees. When Semaphore was
        # changed to extend this class, it lost its ordering
        # guarantees. Unfortunately, that made it unfair. There are
        # rare cases that this can starve a greenlet
        # (https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/1487) and maybe
        # even lead to deadlock (not tested).

        # built-in sets, lists, and dicts, but not ordereddict. Rather than
        # use two data structures, or a dict({link: order}), we simply use a
        # list and remove objects as we go, keeping track of them so as not to
        # have duplicates called. This makes `unlink` O(n), but we can avoid
