    Provide a backdoor to a program for debugging purposes.

    .. warning:: This backdoor provides no authentication and makes no
          attempt to limit what remote users can do. Anyone that
          can access the server can take any action that the running
          python process can. Thus, while you may bind to any interface, for
          security purposes it is recommended that you bind to one

          127.0.0.1/localhost.

        server.serve_forever()

    In a another terminal, connect with...::

        $ telnet 127.0.0.1 5001
        Trying 127.0.0.1...
        Connected to 127.0.0.1.
